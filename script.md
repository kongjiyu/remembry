1. Introduction & The Problem (0:00 - 0:30)
* "We spend countless hours in meetings, but crucial context—decisions, action items, and rationale—often gets lost or buried in messy notes."
* "Standard transcription tools just give you a wall of text that is hard to read and impossible to act on."
* "This is Remembry, an intelligent meeting assistant that transforms raw audio into structured, searchable business intelligence, powered by Google's Gemini 3."

2. The Solution & Core Demo (0:30 - 1:30)
* "Let's see it in action. Here I am recording a product planning meeting directly in the browser." (Show recording interface)
* "Here I'm uploading a 60-minute strategy meeting. **Before hitting process, I select 'Chinese' as my target language.**"
* "Global teams face language barriers, so we leverage Gemini 3's multilingual reasoning to process the English audio and output structured notes directly in the target language."
* "Thanks to Gemini 3's large context window, we can treat the entire hour as a single prompt context. [Video Cuts to Result]"

3. The Result: Multilingual & Structured Intelligence (1:30 - 2:00)
* "And here is the fully analyzed output. You can see the meeting notes are generated in professional Chinese, yet it intelligently preserves technical English terms like 'API' and 'RAG' where appropriate."
* "Unlike generic summaries, Remembry generates structured data." (Point to specific UI sections)
* "We have clear **Decisions**, assigned **Action Items**, and **Q&A pairs**—all in the selected language. This ensures accountability and that nothing slips through the cracks."

4. The "Wow" Factor: Semantic Search / RAG (2:00 - 2:40)
* "But the real power lies in memory. You shouldn't have to remember which meeting a decision was made in."
* "Using our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine, I can simply ask: 'What was the budget approval for the Q1 project?'"
* "Remembry scans across all your uploaded meetings, understands the semantic meaning, and retrieves the exact answer along with the source reference."

5. Closing (2:40 - 3:00)
* "Remembry is built using Next.js and the Gemini 3 API. We're turning meetings from a time-sink into your team's most valuable knowledge asset."
* "Thank you for watching."

  "summary": "The meeting focused on two primary academic projects: the database design for a food delivery application and the implementation of software testing modules. During the first half, the team engaged in a technical debate regarding the ER diagram structure, specifically whether to consolidate or segregate the 'orders', 'delivery', and 'pickup' tables based on overlapping attributes such as addresses and ratings. They also finalized the inclusion of payment systems and voucher functionalities within the database schema.\n\nIn the second half, the discussion shifted to software testing strategies for GitHub. The group selected specific functionalities to evaluate, including user authentication, repository creation, and the GitHub Classroom environment. The meeting concluded with the delegation of modules to individual team members and a plan to document comprehensive test cases and error handling scenarios for their final report.",
